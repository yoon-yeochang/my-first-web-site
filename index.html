    The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) refers to a global information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet . It is often referred to simply as the Web .
    This term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but strictly speaking, they are different concepts. The web is just a service that operates on the Internet, like e-mail . However, since 1993, the Web has taken an absolute position in the structure of the Internet.
